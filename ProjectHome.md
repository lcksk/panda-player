A simple Video Player with read-only playlist.
This player was made for an exhibition. The ui is intended to be as easy to use as possible. All interactions possible are play/pause, seeking and selecting a playlist entry. For now almost all settings are hardcoded but an admin mode is planned in near future.
It's written in C, using GTK+ (glade) and GStreamer.
